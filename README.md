# APFC
Automatic Power Factor correction system
This project presents a robust Automatic Power Factor Correction (APFC) system aimed at enhancing electrical power efficiency by maintaining the power factor close to unity. The system continuously monitors load conditions and dynamically compensates reactive power through automated switching of capacitor banks, thereby minimizing power losses and improving voltage regulation.

Key Features
Continuous real-time monitoring of power factor
Automatic capacitor bank switching based on load reactive power demand
Enhanced system efficiency and reduced energy consumption costs
Modular design with provisions for manual control and status monitoring

System Overview
The APFC system measures voltage and current parameters to compute the power factor accurately. Upon detecting deviations beyond predefined thresholds, the control logic engages or disengages capacitor banks to correct the power factor, ensuring optimal electrical performance and compliance with power quality standards.
